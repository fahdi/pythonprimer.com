  - [Variables and Data Types](/docs/python/variables-data-types)
  - [Control Structures](/docs/python/control-structures)

  - [Object-Oriented Programming Basics](/docs/python/oop-basics)
</details>

### Introduction to Python
- What is Python?
- Installing Python and setting up the environment
- Writing and running your first Python program

### Variables and Data Types
- Declaring variables
- Basic data types: int, float, string, boolean
- Type conversion

### Control Structures
- If-else statements
- For loops
- While loops

### Functions
- Defining and calling functions
- Parameters and return values
- Scope and namespaces

### Lists and Dictionaries
- Creating and manipulating lists
- List comprehensions
- Working with dictionaries

### Object-Oriented Programming Basics
- Classes and objects
- Attributes and methods
- Inheritance and polymorphism

## 3. Integration with Main Curriculum

- At the beginning of each algorithm topic, include a "Prerequisites" section that links to relevant Python basics.
- When introducing new Python concepts in the main curriculum, provide a brief explanation and link to the corresponding Python basics section for more details.

## 4. Practical Examples

For each Python basics topic, include practical examples that relate to algorithms or data structures. For instance:

- Use a list to implement a simple stack when introducing the stack data structure
- Demonstrate how to use a dictionary to count occurrences of elements in an array

## 5. Mini-Projects

After each Python basics section, include a mini-project that combines the learned concepts with simple algorithmic tasks. For example:

- After the "Control Structures" section, create a simple number guessing game
- After the "Lists and Dictionaries" section, implement a basic phonebook application

This approach will help beginners build a solid foundation in Python while gradually introducing them to algorithmic concepts.
