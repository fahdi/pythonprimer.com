## Challenge Overview

- **Duration**: 60 days
- **Difficulty**: Progressive (Easy -> Medium -> Hard)
- **Languages**: Any programming language of your choice. Our examples will be in Python.

## How It Works

1. **Daily Problem**: Each day, you'll be presented with a new algorithmic problem to solve.
2. **Difficulty Progression**: The challenges start easy and gradually increase in difficulty.
3. **Implement & Test**: Write your solution and test it with various inputs.
4. **Learn & Reflect**: After submitting, review other solutions and reflect on what you've learned.
5. **Discussion**: Engage with other participants in our community forums to discuss approaches and insights.

## Rules and Guidelines

1. **Honesty**: Solve problems on your own before looking at solutions.
2. **Consistency**: Try to solve at least one problem every day.
3. **Time Management**: Allocate a fixed time (e.g., 1-2 hours) daily for the challenge.
4. **Language Flexibility**: Feel free to use any programming language, but stick to one for consistency.
5. **Reflection**: Maintain a log of your progress, noting new concepts learned and areas for improvement.

## How to Participate

1. **Sign Up**: No login needed. Start the challenge one day at a time.
2. **Join Our Community**: Participate in our Discord community for daily problem notifications and discussions (to be started in Week 2).
3. **Track Your Solutions**: Fork the GitHub repository to track your solutions (to be done in Week 2).
4. **Start Coding**: Begin your journey with Day 1!

## Prizes and Recognition

- **Completion Certificate**: Awarded to all participants who complete the 60-day challenge.
- **Top Performers**: Special recognition for the top 10% based on problem-solving speed and efficiency.
- **Most Improved**: Awards for participants showing the most significant progress throughout the challenge.
