# Introduction to Algorithms

Welcome to Day 1 of our 60 Days of Coding Algorithm Challenge! Today, we'll start with the basics: What is an algorithm?

## What is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem. It's a set of instructions that takes some input, performs a series of steps, and produces an output.

## Key Characteristics of Algorithms

1. **Input**: An algorithm must have zero or more inputs.
2. **Output**: An algorithm should produce at least one output.
3. **Definiteness**: Each step must be precisely defined.
4. **Finiteness**: The algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps.
5. **Effectiveness**: Each step must be simple enough to be carried out by a human using pencil and paper.

## Example: Simple Addition Algorithm

Let's look at a simple algorithm for adding two numbers:

1. Start
2. Input two numbers, A and B
3. Set SUM = A + B
4. Output SUM
5. End

This simple algorithm takes two inputs, performs one operation, and produces one output.

## Why Are Algorithms Important?

Algorithms are the foundation of computer science and are crucial for several reasons:

1. **Problem Solving**: They provide a systematic approach to solving complex problems.
2. **Efficiency**: Well-designed algorithms can save time and computational resources.
3. **Scalability**: Good algorithms allow programs to handle large amounts of data effectively.
4. **Consistency**: Algorithms ensure that the same process is followed every time, leading to consistent results.

In the coming days, we'll explore more complex algorithms and dive deeper into their analysis and implementation. Stay tuned!

## Exercise

Try to write an algorithm for finding the largest number among three given numbers. Think about the steps you would take and how you would structure the algorithm.

Tomorrow, we'll discuss algorithmic thinking and introduce pseudocode as a way to express algorithms.
