## About the Challenge

The 60 Days of Coding Algorithm Challenge is an intensive program that spans two months. Each day, participants are presented with a new algorithmic problem to solve. The challenges progress in difficulty, covering a wide range of topics from basic array manipulations to advanced graph algorithms.

Key features of the challenge:

- Daily coding problems
- Progressive difficulty (Easy -> Medium -> Hard)
- Covers various data structures and algorithms
- Suitable for beginners and experienced developers
- Community-driven learning and discussion
